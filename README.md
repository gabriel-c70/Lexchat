Welcome to **Lexchat**, an experimental AI project built from the ground up with passion, curiosity, and a vision to create a versatile digital assistant.  
This is the **first publicly released version** — a small but powerful step toward a larger, more advanced AI ecosystem.  

---



Lexchat is a lightweight AI that can:
- ✨ Generate creative stories and jokes  
- 💻 Write and debug simple code  
- 🕹️ Play mini text-based games (like Rock, Paper, Scissors)  
- ⏰ Tell the current time  
- 🔎 Search the web and show recent searches  
- 🖋️ Draw using Turtle graphics  
- 🗣️ Switch between three  *voice modes*
- To know more you can type in the help command which is like a **user menu** for Lexchat

⚠️ **Note:** This AI is still in its early stages. It’s not trained on any large dataset — it’s fully experimental and built for fun, learning, and testing new ideas.

**Tech Talk**

- **Language:** Python 3  
- **Core Libraries:** `time`, `math`, `turtle`, `random`, `os`, `requests`  
- **Optional Tools:** `PyTorch`, `TensorFlow` *(for advanced AI expansion)*

⚠️ **Cautions & Limitations**
--
This AI is for educational and experimental purposes **only**.
Do not use Lexchat for real-world decision-making, automation, or **private data processing**.
Output may be inaccurate or nonsensical — it’s part of the early testing process.
--
**Future versions will include safety filters, better data handling,model training enhancements, and **so on**.**

## Vision
Lexchat represents the seed of a much greater idea — a self-improving AI ecosystem powered by curiosity, community, and massive compute.
The long-term goal is to scale this to a trained model and eventually deploy it on TPUs and GPUs for real deep learning performance.

"Every great AI begins with a single experiment — Lexchat is mine."

## 💬 Final Note
Lexchat might be small now, but it’s the start of something big.
From a few lines of Python to a future filled with TPUs and trained intelligence — this project is just the beginning.



## Getting Started
**To get started simply hit the Py.py folder then copy it and test it,run it, and more**
